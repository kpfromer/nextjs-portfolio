Here are my solutions to
[exercise 2](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html#exercise_513527).

## The Architecture of Neural Networks

### Question

![4 node output neural network](/neural-net.png)

There is a way of determining the bitwise representation of a digit by adding an extra layer to the
three-layer network above. The extra layer converts the output from the previous layer into a binary
representation, as illustrated in the figure below. Find a set of weights and biases for the new
output layer. Assume that the first $3$ layers of neurons are such that the correct output in the
third layer (i.e., the old output layer) has activation at least $0.99$, and incorrect outputs have
activation less than $0.01$.

### Solution

This is converting a base-ten value to base-two value.

I first listed out all the possible numbers.

$$
\begin{aligned}
  (9)_{10} &= (1001)_2\\
  (8)_{10} &= (1000)_2\\
  (7)_{10} &= (0111)_2\\
  (6)_{10} &= (0110)_2\\
  (5)_{10} &= (0101)_2\\
  (4)_{10} &= (0100)_2\\
  (3)_{10} &= (0011)_2\\
  (2)_{10} &= (0010)_2\\
  (1)_{10} &= (0001)_2\\
  (0)_{10} &= (0000)_2
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Node One

I noticed that the first thing I could do it solve for the first binary digit. The first binary
digit tells us whether or not the number is odd or even. I found that the bias is unnecessary since
the dot product will produce either $1$ or $0$. The weights for the first node are as follows:

> I am going to denote the weight due to number in the old output layer, $j$, $w_j$

$$
\begin{aligned}
  w_{9} &= 1\\
  w_{8} &= 0\\
  w_{7} &= 1\\
  w_{6} &= 0\\
  w_{5} &= 1\\
  w_{4} &= 0\\
  w_{3} &= 1\\
  w_{2} &= 0\\
  w_{1} &= 1\\
  w_{0} &= 0
\end{aligned}
$$

So if the value is odd the $w \cdot x = 1$ and if even $w \cdot x = 0$.

#### Node Two

For node two it should only be activated if the numbers are $\{ 2,3,6,7 \}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
  w_{9} &= 0\\
  w_{8} &= 0\\
  w_{7} &= 1\\
  w_{6} &= 1\\
  w_{5} &= 0\\
  w_{4} &= 0\\
  w_{3} &= 1\\
  w_{2} &= 1\\
  w_{1} &= 0\\
  w_{0} &= 0
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Node Three

For node three it should only be activated if the numbers are $\{ 4,5,6,7 \}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
  w_{9} &= 0\\
  w_{8} &= 0\\
  w_{7} &= 1\\
  w_{6} &= 1\\
  w_{5} &= 1\\
  w_{4} &= 1\\
  w_{3} &= 0\\
  w_{2} &= 0\\
  w_{1} &= 0\\
  w_{0} &= 0
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Node Four

For node four it should only be activated if the numbers are $\{ 8,9 \}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
  w_{9} &= 1\\
  w_{8} &= 1\\
  w_{7} &= 0\\
  w_{6} &= 0\\
  w_{5} &= 0\\
  w_{4} &= 0\\
  w_{3} &= 0\\
  w_{2} &= 0\\
  w_{1} &= 0\\
  w_{0} &= 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Again, there are **no biases** for any of the nodes.

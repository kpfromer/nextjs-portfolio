Here are my solutions to
[exercise 4](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html#exercise_717502).

## Implementing Our Network to Classify Digits

### Part 1

#### Question

Write out $a'=\sigma(wa+b)$ in component form, and verify that it gives the same result as the rule,
$\frac{1}{1+\exp(- \sum_j w_j x_j - b)}$, for computing the output of a sigmoid neuron.

#### Solution

Let it be stated that I have not yet taken linear algebra at college, so I have very limited
experience with it.

Let us say that layer 2 has $2$ nodes and layer 1 has $3$ nodes.

The weights from layer 1 to layer 2 can be expressed as the following ($w_{ji}$, where $j$ is the
neuron in the second layer and $i$ is the neuron in the first layer):

$$
w = \begin{bmatrix}
    w_{11} & w_{12} & w_{13}\\
    w_{21} & w_{22} & w_{23}
\end{bmatrix}

a = \begin{bmatrix}
    a_1\\
    a_2\\
    a_3
\end{bmatrix}

b = \begin{bmatrix}
    b_1\\
    b_2
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
wa = \begin{bmatrix}
    w_{11} a_1 + w_{12} a_2 + w_{13} a_3\\
    w_{21} a_1 + w_{22} a_2 + w_{23} a_3
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
wa + b = \begin{bmatrix}
    (w_{11} a_1 + w_{12} a_2 + w_{13} a_3) + b_1\\
    (w_{21} a_1 + w_{22} a_2 + w_{23} a_3) + b_2
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
a' = \sigma(wa + b) = \begin{bmatrix}
    \sigma((w_{11} a_1 + w_{12} a_2 + w_{13} a_3) + b_1)\\
    \sigma((w_{21} a_1 + w_{22} a_2 + w_{23} a_3) + b_2)
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This is exactly the same as $\frac{1}{1+\exp(- \sum_j w_j x_j - b)}$ but computed for both neurons
at once with matrices!

Say we wanted to compute the output of the first sigmoid neuron in layer 2.

$$
a_1' = \sigma(\sum_j w_j a_j + b) = \sigma((w_1 a_1 + w_2 a_2 + w_3 a_3) + b)
$$

Also, I wanted to note that I found this website called the
[ml cheatsheet](https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/linear_algebra.html) and it has been
really useful in describing the mathematic concepts.

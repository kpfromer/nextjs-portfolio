Here are my solutions to

## Learning with Gradient Descent

### Part 1

#### Question

Prove the assertion of the last paragraph. Hint: If you're not already familiar with the
[Cauchy-Schwarz inequality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality), you may
find it helpful to familiarize yourself with it.

Here is the paragraph he is referring to.

> Indeed, there's even a sense in which gradient descent is the optimal strategy for searching for a
> minimum. Let's suppose that we're trying to make a move $\Delta v$ in position so as to decrease
> $C$ as much as possible. This is equivalent to minimizing
> $\Delta C \approx \triangledown C \cdot \Delta v$. We'll constrain the size of the move so that
> $\lVert \Delta v \rVert = \epsilon$ for some small fixed $\epsilon > 0$. In other words, we want a

> $\lVert \Delta v \rVert = \epsilon$. So gradient descent can be viewed as a way of taking small
> steps in the direction which does the most to immediately decrease $C$.

#### Solution

The goal here is to minimize $C$ which implies that we are trying to minimize $\Delta C$ (can be
rewritten as $\Delta C = C_\text{final} - C_\text{initial}$) as best as we can. We want
$C_\text{final} < C_\text{initial}$, meaning we want $\Delta C < 0$ since
$\Delta C + C_\text{initial} = C_\text{final}$.

We know that $\Delta C \approx \triangledown C \cdot \Delta v$ for small fixed $\epsilon > 0$. To
make $\Delta C < 0$ we must $\Delta v$ must be in a direction opposite of $\triangledown C$. This is
given by the definition of a dot product. The dot product is a value that represents how much two
vectors are parallel. The maximum value of a dot product is produced when two vectors are **in the
exact same direction (parallel)** and the most negative value is produced when the two vectors are
in **exactly opposite directions (antiparallel)**. So to produce the most negative value we much
choose a $\Delta v$ such that it is in the opposite direction of $\triangledown C$. We can rewrite
$\Delta v = -\eta \triangledown C$. $\eta = \frac{\epsilon}{\lVert \triangledown C \rVert}$ is
defined as such because we want the vector to be a fraction of the $\triangledown C$ that way we do
not overshoot the minimum.

### Part 2

#### Question

I explained gradient descent when $C$ is a function of two variables, and when it's a function of
more than two variables. What happens when $C$ is a function of just one variable? Can you provide a
geometric interpretation of what gradient descent is doing in the one-dimensional case?

#### Solution

> Please note the particular values for the graph **do not matter**; it is the **shape of the curve
> that matters**.

To minimize $C$ with a gradient descent algorithm is quite simple in a one-dimensional example. This
is because $\triangledown C = C'(v)$ or in English the gradient is equal to the derivative of the
function. So, looking at the image above, at point $v=-4$ the tangent line seems to have a negative
slope and thus $\triangledown C = C'(v) < 0$, therefore when we move in the direction
$- \eta \triangledown C$ we increase $v$ and move down the slope toward the right.

### Part 3

#### Question

An extreme version of gradient descent is to use a mini-batch size of just $1$. That is, given a
training input, $x$, we update our weights and biases according to the rules
$w_k \to w_k' = w_k - \eta \frac{\partial C_x}{\partial w_k}$ and
$b_l \to b_l' = b_l - \eta \frac{\partial C_x}{\partial b_l}$. Then we choose another training
input, and update the weights and biases again. And so on, repeatedly. This procedure is known as
online, on-line, or incremental learning. In online learning, a neural network learns from just one
training input at a time (just as human beings do). Name one advantage and one disadvantage of
online learning, compared to stochastic gradient descent with a mini-batch size of, say, $20$.

#### Solution

##### Advantage of Online Learning

The advantage of online learning has over stochastic gradient descent is that it will be much better
at tuning the biases and weights to reduce the cost function for each given training input. It will
not be using the estimated gradient but will be calculating the actual gradient and thus will
produce better results. But one must do the cost-benefit analysis to see whether online learning,
which is much slower but accurate, produces better results faster than stochastic gradient descent,
which is fast but less accurate.

##### Disadvantage of Online Learning

The major disadvantage of online learning is that it is much slower than stochastic gradient descent
since you have to train the network over every single training input $x$. So if you have a large
dataset, like the MNIST data set with 60,000 images, then online learning will have to calculate the
partial derivative for each weight and biases for each image ($\frac{\partial C_x}{\partial w_k}$
and $\frac{\partial C_x}{\partial b_l}$ for a given $x$).

Stochastic gradient descent will only need to calculate the partial derivatives for a fraction of
the data set (in this case, $20$ images) and then adjust the weights and biases simultaneously based
on that mini-batch. This a heck of a lot faster than doing it one by one for 60,000 images!
